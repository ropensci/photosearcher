This vignette provides an overview of the functions in R package `photosearcher`.

## Saving your key
The first time you use this package save your API key and it will automatically be used by all other functions.
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Save your key
  save_key(api_key = "your API key")
```

## Searching for photographs
These are a few basic example of the main photo_search function:
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Search for photos of foxes in the UK for the year 2017
  foxes <- photo_search(mindate = "2017-01-01",
             maxdate = "2018-01-01",
             text = "foxes",
             bbox = "-12.875977,49.210420,2.636719,59.977005",
             has_geo = TRUE)  

  #Search for images of trees globally for the 1st of January 2019
  trees <- photo_search(mindate = "2019-01-01",
             maxdate = "2019-01-01",
             text = "tree",
             has_geo = TRUE)

  #Search for images with text mountain and tagged lake
  moutain_lake <- photo_search(mindate = "2019-01-01",
             maxdate = "2019-01-01",
             text = "mountain",
             tags = "lake"
             has_geo = FALSE)
```
When the arguement `has_geo` is `TRUE` all images will contain latitude and longitude infomation. These can be plotted using other packages at user preference. Here, the images of UK foxes are plotted using `ggplot2`.

## Downloading images
The package can also download the images based of of their unique id number. You can direct the download to any save directory, if it doesnt exists it will be automatically created.
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Downloading fox images from photosearch
  download_images(photo_id = foxes$id, saveDir = "Fox images")

  #Download a specific images based off its id
  download_images(photo_id = 47416147181)
```
The package will only download images that the owner on Flickr has granted download permission. Those without permission will not be downloaded, but will produce a warning to let know the ID numbers of those skipped. Permission to download does not automatically provide permission to use and distribute, check the photographs licence before use. The `photo_search` function provides the licence information for each image.

## Finding information on a user
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find a users hometown
  user <- user_info(user_id = "22299651@N07")

  user$hometown
```

## Get the top tags for a location
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find the tags for Southampton, UK
  southampton <- location_tags(woe_id = 35356)
  
  #Find the tags for New York state, US
  new_york <- location_tags(woe_id = 	2347591)

```
The woe_id arguement is a FLickr specific place identifier. A places woeID can be found using the `find_place` function or using [online tools](http://woeid.rosselliot.co.nz/). 

## Find a locations woeID
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find woeID for Kuala Lumpur
  kuala_lumpur <- find_place(place = "Kuala Lumpur")

  kuala_lumpaur$woeid
```

## Finding tags most associated with another tag
```{r eval=FALSE}
  #Find tags associated with zebra
  zebra <- related_terms(term = "zebra")

  #Find tags most assoicated with hiking
  hiking <- related_terms(term = "hiking")
  
  #Find tags most associated with the word church
  church <- related_terms(term = "church")

```
